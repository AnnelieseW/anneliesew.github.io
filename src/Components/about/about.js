                        <p>
                            I'm a student in the School of Planning at the University of Waterloo. I am currently pursuing Honours Planning, specializing in land development, and a Joint Honours in Mathematics with a Computing Minor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I hope to combine both these interests and work at the intersection of Planning, Technology, and Transportation. I believe in the use of technology as a meaningful tool to inform planning decisions and am excited to see the integration of ubiquitous computing in our built environment.
                           </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm an advocate for inclusive and accessible technology. You can find me running around organizing hackathons with StarterHacks (Canadaâ€™s largest beginner hackathon!) and EnergyHacks (bringing technology and policy together!), tinkering with code, or planning my next adventure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm currently seeking Fall 2020 internship opportunities in software development, product management and planning.
