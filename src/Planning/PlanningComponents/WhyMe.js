                        I am quick to adapt to new environments and I take the initiative to put in the extra effort to make the most of my opportunities.

                        In my first year of highschool, I decided I wanted to experience what it what be like to live in
                        a different culture. My school didn't have any exchange opportunities for me so I found my own.
                        In Grade 10, I spent a year in Switzerland and I quickly found out that all being in a classroom
                        speaking french was much different than  speaking french in a foreign country where you don't know
                        anyone, or anyone on that continent for that matter. I was also the youngest participant in my cohort of exchange students.
                        It didn't matter because I had a great time and I credit this to being resilient, gritty, and not being afraid of stepping outside of my comfort zone.
